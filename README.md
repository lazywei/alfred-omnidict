Alfred OmniDict
==================

## What?

**OmniDict** is an Alfred workflow for looking up definition in several English
dictionaries, including:

- [Vocabulary.com](http://www.vocabulary.com/)
- [Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/)

## How?

1. Download the [OmniDict.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/lazywei/alfred-omnidict/blob/master/OmniDict.alfredworkflow) in this repo, and import it into Alfred's Workflow.

2. Type `od` followed by the word you'd like to search, for example: `od resolve`
